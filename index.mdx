# What is AgentTest?

AgentTest is an open-source A/B testing and analytics platform designed specifically for **AI agents** and **prompt workflows**. It enables developers and product teams to run experiments on multiple agent variants, collect real-world metrics, and make data-driven decisions â€” **without handing over deployment**.

AgentTest aims to provide:

*   A lightweight SDK for easy integration
*   A backend API for assignment & logging
*   A dashboard (coming soon) for managing experiments
*   Future support for observability via OpenTelemetry
