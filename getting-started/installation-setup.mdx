# Installation & Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up the AgentTest backend for local development.

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment ready:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agenttest/agenttest-backend
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd agenttest-backend
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open the `.env` file and add your Supabase Database URL and a secure API key.
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="your_supabase_connection_string"
    API_KEY="your_super_secret_api_key"
    ```
    <Note>
      Replace `"your_supabase_connection_string"` with your actual Supabase Postgres connection string and
      `"your_super_secret_api_key"` with a strong, unique API key.
    </Note>

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**
    This command will apply the database schema to your Supabase instance.
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit push
    ```
    <Note>
    The `drizzle-kit push` command is for development environments. For production, you should use `drizzle-kit generate` and manage SQL migration files. Refer to Drizzle ORM documentation for more details.
    </Note>


6.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

You are now ready to make requests to your local AgentTest backend instance.
